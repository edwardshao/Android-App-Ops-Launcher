Android App Ops Launcher
========
Android 4.3 introduces a feature to let you manage the permissions used by apps.
This feature has a hidden activity: App Ops

You can find the intent action name is [ASOP source code](http://androidxref.com/4.3_r2.1/xref/packages/apps/Settings/AndroidManifest.xml#797).

I just wrote a super simple App to invoke the activity.  
Just for fun~~~

Thanks

This App uses a icon from [igh0zt](http://igh0zt.deviantart.com/).  
Icon Link: [MetroUI Folder OS Security Denied Icon](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/ios7-style-metro-ui-icons-by-igh0zt/MetroUI-Folder-OS-Security-Denied-icon.html)  
Many thanks.
